./vivado - Odds and ends to help with the Xilinx Vivado tools

In this directory:

- README.md - This file
- build.sh -  Bash script to launch Vivado to generate a bitstream
- build.tcl - TCL script to build the design (without writing the bitstream)
- test.sh -  Bash script to run the basic ISA tests.
- test.tcl - TCL script to run the test bench to verify basic ISA operation

If you want to use the GUI create your own Vivado project and just add in the required VHDL and constraints.

Reminder to download the bitstream:

```bash
djtgcfg prog -d Nexys4DDR -i 0 -f ../bitstreams/nexys4ddr_top_level.bit 
```
